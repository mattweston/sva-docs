When someone becomes a member they get :

1. A profile on the Artists Network website if they’re a visual artist.
2. Added to the Google newsgroup.
3. A thank you email to say : Thank you for becoming a member!

When someone becomes a member we need to :

1. Update their info on CiviCRM - Add them to a contact if they’re not already on there. Record membership for the year, add ‘Associate member’ tag.
2. Email them to see if they’re a visual artist and let them know about how we can add them to the Artists Network.
3. Add to Google Newsgroup.

Example email :

"Thank you for becoming a member of SVA!

For the coming year you’ll be supporting the artistic programme and support SVA with its future work, so we’re really grateful.

If you’re a visual artist we can add your profile to the Artists Network, which is a public directory of local artists.

For the website we’ll need a square image that is at least 1000px by 1000px (to be high quality), and any contact details and social media links that you would like to be shown publicly. You can find the page here to get an idea for it : [SVA Artists Network](https://www.svastudios.org.uk/artists-network)

We will also add you to the Google Newsgroup, so keep an eye out for an invite. It’s where members can post messages about local exhibitions etc, and the messages come via email so you don’t need to sign in to an account.
If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to email us at office@sva.org.uk"
